                Hi, my name is <b>Ogede, Peculiar</b>. I'm a frontend developer (beginner-level).
                I must say, there is nothing more fascinating to me than creating beautiful things using
                just codes. <i>It's fascinating</i>. That is what i love about technology.
                It gives you powerful tools to create solutions that make life easier, which is why I chose to venture
                into it. Being a techie is one of the most amazing things that has happened to me in life.

                The journey so far has been challenging and fun at the same time. I've never enjoyed
                learning so much than when I started the growth accelerator program at <b>Stutern</b>. I've learnt so
                much
                about HTML and CSS and I'm finally beginning to understand some things that i couldnt grasp when i
                started learning
                at freecodecamp, things like <i>specificity and inheritance</i>. I've also learnt so much about the
                roles that
                each web technology has to play in the building oe websites and webapps and I'd be focusing on CSS.
                CSS is a stylesheet language and is used to give beauty to the website. It's importamce cannot be
                overemphasized
                as every developer knows that users would always love what is beautiful and attractive to the eyes.
                This is where CSS comes in.

                One of the most important styling in a webpage is its arrangement. This is basically done using
                padding, margin and borders. What is the difference between them then?<br />
                <br />
                <b>Padding</b> is the space between an elements content and its border.<br />
                <b>Margin</b> is the space between an elements container and the surrounding elements or body of the
                webpage. It is outside
                the box of the element.<br />
                <b>Border</b> is the demarcation between the elements content and its surrounding i.e outside the
                element.
